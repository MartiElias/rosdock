# rosdock
### rosdock â€” Portable ROS 2 development made simple rosdock lets you use Docker as if it were your native ROS 2 environment.   It automatically detects your `*_ws` workspaces, mounts them, and sets up the environment dynamically so you can build and run ROS 2 projects from any directory.

Note: Under development.
